    <h3>This super-easy cobbler is great for unexpected company or spur-of-the-moment cravings. The juice from the fruit cooks out to produce enough moisture to make this cobbler delicious. You can also use fresh peaches instead of apples.</h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 Granny Smith apples, cored and sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x9-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, butter, and cinnamon together in a bowl using a pastry blender or fork until crumbly; reserve 3/4 cup flour mixture to use as topping.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a light layer of flour mix into the prepared baking dish; top with a layer of apples. Continue alternating layers of flour mixture with apples and ending with apples. Sprinkle top apple layer with the reserved 3/4 cup flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until apples are tender and topping is lightly browned, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow cobbler to cool for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
